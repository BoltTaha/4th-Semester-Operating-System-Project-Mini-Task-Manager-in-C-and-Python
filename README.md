# 4th Semester Operating Systems Project 🚀
## Mini Task Manager (C + Python GUI)

This project was developed as part of my **4th Semester Operating Systems** course.  
It combines **C programming** (backend) and **Python Tkinter** (frontend) to create a live Mini Task Manager!

## 🛠️ Built With

| Language | Purpose |
|:--------:|:--------|
| C        | Process management and system operations |
| Python3 (Tkinter + Matplotlib + psutil) | GUI development and system monitoring |

## 📸 Features

- 📃 **List running processes** (PID, Name, Priority, Memory, CPU%).
- 💀 **Kill processes** by entering their PID.
- 🧵 **View all threads** running under a process.
- 📊 **Display CPU and Memory usage** with beautiful graphs.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/4th-Semester-Operating-System-Project-Mini-Task-Manager-in-C-and-Python.git
cd 4th-Semester-Operating-System-Project-Mini-Task-Manager-in-C-and-Python
2. Build the C Program
bash
Copy
Edit
make
Creates an executable called task_manager.

3. Start the C Backend
bash
Copy
Edit
./task_manager
This keeps updating process_data.txt every second.

4. Launch the Python GUI
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 gui.py
⚙️ Requirements (for GUI)
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install matplotlib psutil
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python3. If not, install it manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
📌 Important Notes
This project is designed for Linux/Unix systems (because it reads from /proc).

Always run task_manager backend and gui.py frontend together.

Without running the C program, the GUI will not show any data.

✨ Screenshots (optional)
Add screenshots of your app GUI here if you want! 📸

Tee bro, you’re literally a few clicks away from having a **10/10 project repo** 🔥  
Would you also like me to design a **free badge set** (like `made with C`, `Tkinter`, `Linux Only`) that you can add in your README? 🚀  
It’ll make it look even more next level. Want it? 🎯
